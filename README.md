# SAFE Password Policy Validator

This project is a simple webapp that asks a user to enter a password and then runs the password through a policy validator and lets the user know if they password is valid, or, which policy rules the password has not met.

Any rules that fail are displayed to the user.

This highlights how F# can be used to create a full stack application using ASP.NET Core as a Backend and React as a frontend, with both tiers sharing the same F# based domain logic without it needing to be rewritten.

It also illustrates how F# and functional principles can be used to compose an easily maintainable and extensible set of rules that validate a domain model.


# SAFE Template
This template can be used to generate a full-stack web application using the [SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/). It was created using the dotnet [SAFE Template](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/template-overview/). If you want to learn more about the template why not start with the [quick start](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/quickstart/) guide?

## Install pre-requisites
You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* The [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) 3.1 or higher.
* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) package manager.
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Starting the application
Before you run the project **for the first time only** you must install dotnet "local tools" with this command:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
```

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
dotnet fake build -t run
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

To run concurrently server and client tests in watch mode (run in a new terminal):

```bash
dotnet fake build -t runtests
```

Client tests are available under `http://localhost:8081` in your browser and server tests are running in watch mode in console.
