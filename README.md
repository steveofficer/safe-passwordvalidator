# SAFE Password Policy Validator

This application was created using the dotnet [SAFE Template](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/template-overview/). If you want to learn more about the template why not start with the [quick start](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/quickstart/) guide?

This project is a simple webapp that asks a user to enter a password and then runs the password through a policy validator and lets the user know if they password is valid, or, which policy rules the password has not met.

Any rules that fail are displayed to the user.

This highlights how F# can be used to create a full stack application using ASP.NET Core as a Backend and React as a frontend, but using the same domain logic in both the front-end and the back-end.

This means that you do not need to rewrite your business rules once in C# and once in TypeScript#\JavaScript.

It also illustrates how F# and functional principles can be used to compose an easily maintainable and extensible set of rules that validate a domain model.

## Install pre-requisites

You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* The [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
* [FAKE 5](https://fake.build/) installed as a [global tool](https://fake.build/fake-gettingstarted.html#Install-FAKE)
* The [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package manager (you an also use `npm` but the usage of `yarn` is encouraged).
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed for the front end components.
* If you're running on OSX or Linux, you'll also need to install [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/).

## Work with the application

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
fake build -t Run
```

## Troubleshooting

* **fake not found** - If you fail to execute `fake` from command line after installing it as a global tool, you might need to add it to your `PATH` manually: (e.g. `export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet/tools:$PATH"` on unix) - [related GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/9321)
